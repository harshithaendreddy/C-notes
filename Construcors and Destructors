#Construcors and Destructors

Constructor is called as soon as the object is created.

Parameterized Constructors

These are used when the user wants to give the value to be initialise class member variable when an object is created.

Usage of Parameterized Constructors

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Demo{
    public:
    int i;
    float f;
    Demo(int val, float fval){
        i=val;
        f=fval;
    }
};
int main()
{
    Demo demo(1000,1.0);
    Demo demo2(2000,2.0);
    
    cout << demo.i << " & " << demo.f << endl;
    cout << demo2.i << " & " << demo2.f << endl;

    return 0;
}
